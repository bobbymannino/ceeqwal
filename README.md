# Ceeqwal

Welcome to Ceeqwal (pronounced "sequel"), a simple SQL editor built with Delphi.
I have created this project purely for my own education and to learn more about
Delphi. As stated it is a simple SQL editor so it is not intended to be used for
anything other than "fun" and learning.

At the moment there is no usable product, but if you are interested in using the
project when it comes out (including pre-release) you can subscribe to releases
on GitHub.
